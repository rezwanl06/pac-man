# pac-man
I used Java PApplet Library to make a clone of the Pac-man game. This was an assignment I completed some time back. Includes JUnit testing. Due to time constraints at that time, I was unable to finish the behaviour of the ghosts. Everything else is complete and works. Uses gradle to build and run the application.
